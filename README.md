# Tenants Dashboard Practice Project

This is a practice project for building a tenants dashboard using **React**, **Next.js**, and **Node.js**. The goal is to learn and experiment with modern web development tools and patterns, including API integration, state management, and responsive UI design.

## Features

- **Profile Management:** View and update user profile information, including name, email, phone, and payment details.
- **API Integration:** Fetch and update profile data using RESTful endpoints.
- **Responsive Design:** Layout adapts to different screen sizes using Tailwind CSS.
- **Practice UI:** Simple, clean interface for learning and experimentation.

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev

3. **Open your browser:**
